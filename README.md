### Mat's Config Files

These config files are written to make setting up and syncing configs between machines easier.

If you're going to use these, be sure to change the name and email in the [git config](https://github.com/mpataki/config_files/blob/master/git/git_config).

Install the config files by running the [setup_machine](https://github.com/mpataki/config_files/blob/master/setup_machine) script.
