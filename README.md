### Mat's Config Files

These pull some functionality out of [Pitr's . files](https://github.com/pitr/config_files), but have been slimmed down significantly, changed in many ways, and added to in others.

If you're going to use these, be sure to change the name and email in the [git config](https://github.com/mpataki/config_files/blob/master/git/git_config).

Install the config files by running the [install_config_files](https://github.com/mpataki/config_files/blob/master/install_config_files) script.
