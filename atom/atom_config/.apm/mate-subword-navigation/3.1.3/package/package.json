The only difference from Textmate keybindings is in the delete subword hotkey. Atom shipped with the Bracket Matcher package, which use ctrl+backspace to delete matching brackets, so I have decided to map delete subword to ctrl+shift+backspace.\n\n**Harness the power of CTRL as you battle the mighty camelCase and treacherous snake_case.**\n\nThis package allows you to move the cursor(s) to beginning and end of words, but also it stops at subwords (camelCase and snake_case).\n\n- Holding `shift` will highlight as you move left and right.\n\n- Along with highlight, you can delete to the previous/next subword. Command names are at the bottom of the page.\n\n- Issues and pull requests are welcome.\n\n### Instructions\n\n|     Mac     |            |            |\n|-------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| Move around | `ctrl-left`  | `ctrl-right`       |\n| Highlight   | `ctrl-shift-left` | `ctrl-shift-right` |\n| Delete      | `ctrl-shift-backspace` | `ctrl-delete` |\n\n### Dependencies\nRequires Atom v0.204 and up\n\n\n### Commands\n```coffee\n'subword-navigation:move-right'\n'subword-navigation:move-left'\n'subword-navigation:select-right'\n'subword-navigation:select-left'\n'subword-navigation:delete-right'\n'subword-navigation:delete-left'\n```\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/mendab1e/atom-mate-subword-navigation#readme","_id":"mate-subword-navigation@3.1.3","_shasum":"6b4ef5bca3313647bb4e78ec6c8ce7d13add1f89","_resolved":"file:../d-1151123-59083-9xamxz/package.tgz","_from":"../d-1151123-59083-9xamxz/package.tgz"}
